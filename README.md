There are over 8,000 characters in the chinese language. It seems like an impossible task
to memorize even a few hundred of the most common ones, that's why memory spaced
repetition is crucial to learn the language.
This year I decided to take up Mandarin, but the time I spent learning programming made
it difficult to find time to fit it in my schedule. That's why I decided to create "HSK
Flashcards" a Python Program built with a KivyMD interface that has all the vocabulary a
student needs to pass each of the HSK Exams (the official chinese language learning
exams) and presents it in the way of simple flashcards that include pronounciation.
